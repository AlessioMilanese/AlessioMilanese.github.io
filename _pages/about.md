I am a PhD student at EMBL Heidelberg in the group of Dr. Georg Zeller.
During my PhD I am developing tools to improve the analysis of microbiome data. In particular, I am interested in taxonomic profiling tools: how we can retrieve the composition of a microbial community from high-throughput sequencing data (either from whole metagenome sequencing or 16s rRNA gene amplicon).
